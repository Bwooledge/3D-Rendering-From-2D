This is a school project made in 2023 for my first semester project of Computer Science III Advanced Honors. 
It was originally intended to be a physics simulator that had everything from collisions to electric fields, but as of right now every kind of force and movement needs to be hardcoded in.
I may continue this project in the future, but this is it as of now. To run the sample scene I created, run the GraphicsRunner.java file. To edit the scene, change objects in the Simulation.java file.
