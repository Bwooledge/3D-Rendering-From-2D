This is a school project I made in 2023 for my first-semester project in Computer Science III Advanced Honors. 

It was originally intended to be a physics simulator with the concepts from Physics C Mechanics and E&M. Due to time and library limits, I was only able to finish 3D rendering and motion. I may continue this project in the future, but I would likely use a dedicated 3D graphics library for performance. 

To run the sample scene I created, run the GraphicsRunner.java file. To edit the scene, change objects in the Simulation.java file. 

Movement uses the keys W, A, S, and D and camera movement uses the keys I, J, K, and L.
